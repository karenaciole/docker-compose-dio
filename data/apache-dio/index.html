		<p>Whales are fascinating creatures that have captured the attention and imagination of people for centuries. Here are some curiosities about whales:

		<li>Whales are the largest animals on earth, with the blue whale being the largest known animal that has ever existed.</li>

			<li>Whales are mammals, which means they breathe air and nurse their young with milk.</li>

				<li>Whales can communicate with each other using a variety of sounds, including songs and clicks.</li>

					<li>Some whale species are known for their incredible migrations. For example, gray whales travel more than 10,000 miles every year from their summer feeding grounds in the Arctic to their winter breeding grounds in the warmer waters of Mexico.</li>

					<li>Whales are found in every ocean in the world and come in many different shapes and sizes. There are over 80 species of whales, ranging from the small dwarf sperm whale to the massive blue whale.</li>
					
					<li>Whales are important to the ecosystem of the oceans. They help to maintain a balance in the food chain, and their waste products provide nutrients for other marine life.</li>

					<li>Whales have a unique anatomy, with adaptations that allow them to survive in the harsh marine environment. For example, their blubber helps to keep them warm in cold water, and their powerful tails enable them to swim long distances.<li>
							
							<li>Whaling has been a controversial issue for many years, with some countries still hunting whales for their meat, oil, and other products. However, there has been a growing movement to protect these magnificent creatures, and many countries have implemented conservation measures to help preserve whale populations.</li>

							<li>Overall, whales are remarkable animals that have much to teach us about the oceans and the world we live in.</li>
